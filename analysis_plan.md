Occation: Meeting with Tony and Stefan about analysis goals
Date: 2019-06-06

# General
two bits of analysis:
- landscape study
- overall stats on database: https://transpose-publishing.github.io/react-app/#/

# Data import for transpose landscape study
first row until publisher, after third row.
in raw sheet.


# Analysis ideas
landscape:
- analyse by publisher, field

standardize publisher names, there might be slight misspellings.

- text policies: bag of words, look at word frequencies.


No and not specified in open peer review might need to be merged, because coding
wasnt strict.


Maybe include data from crossref:
- journal
- n articles per year

# Output
- Bulletpoints about results. think about whether stuff it is interesting or not.
- RMarkdown document is fine.

# Timeline
Play around til friday.
