Cosubmission
If you think your paper might be suitable for two Cell Press journals, you can submit the paper for joint consideration. To do this, upload your manuscript to one of the journals. In your cover letter, indicate that you are seeking co-consideration and mention the name of the other journal. Each journal will evaluate the paper independently. If both journals decide to review the paper, they will agree on reviewers and will make independent decisions based on feedback from those reviewers.

Transfer of Papers between Cell Press Journals
We know it can be time consuming to serially submit your paper to multiple journals, restarting the review process each time. Cell Press publishes many journals, and we give you the opportunity to transfer your paper, along with the reviews and the reviewers' identities, from one journal to another. If you have questions about the suitability of your paper for transfer, please contact the editor of the receiving journal. If you have general questions about the transfer process, please refer to our FAQs on article transfers. Often, the Editor of the target journal will be able to reach a decision based on the existing reviews. Occasionally, the Editor may seek comments from additional reviewers. If you transfer your paper using our online system, you will have a chance to edit your files before they are sent to the receiving journal. You can always submit your paper to another Cell Press journal without mentioning the first review process.

We also take seriously our responsibility to support informed scientific journalism, and look to encourage balanced and accurate coverage that avoids inappropriate hype.

 Although a member of the Physical Review family of journals, Physical Review X is editorially independent of the other journals. Its editors make their own decisions on manuscripts under consideration by the journal.
 Procedurally, the Physical Review family journals, including Physical Review Letters and Physical Review X, allow transfer of a manuscript from one journal to another to take place, provided that the topic of the manuscript fits within the scope of the latter journal. However, the editors of that journal will make their own decision on the disposition of the transferred manuscript.
 Under this general policy, the editors of Physical Review X may reject the transferred manuscript without external review if they judge that the manuscript does not fulfill the journal's stringent acceptance criteria. Since the scope of Physical Review X is intended to be broader than what is currently covered by the other Physical Review journals, it is natural that Physical Review X may reconsider papers that have been rejected by the other Physical Review journals primarily for the reason of unmatched scope. In such cases, the editors of Physical Review X may seek external review of the transferred manuscript before reaching a final decision.
