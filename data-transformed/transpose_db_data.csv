However, authors should be advised that the degree to which the submitted manuscript overlaps with what is already posted on the preprint server may affect the novelty of the findings for ASCO journal readership, and this will be taken into account in the evaluation of the manuscript. If a report has been published on a preprint server prior to manuscript submission, this must be acknowledged during the submission process.

Failure to acknowledge prior dissemination of research posted on preprint servers or similar databases will jeopardize the status of the submission. When such a manuscript has been submitted to an ASCO journal, no revisions should be posted to the preprint server during the manuscript's peer review process. If the manuscript is eventually accepted for publication, no revisions should be posted on the preprint server until the final manuscript is published online by ASCO, and any such revisions must not deviate from the final version of the manuscript published by ASCO.

1) preliminary editorial review and

2) double blind review.


The editorial board reserves the right to reject the article at the preliminary review stage in case its the text does not meet the standards of the journal.

Articles accepted by the editorial board for further consideration are subject to double blind peer review. The authoritative scientists whose specialization is close to the subject of the article and who have scientific publications within this scope of study are to be chosen as the reviewers. Reviewing is anonymous both for reviewers and for the author.

Double blind peer review procedure lasts for up to 2 months from the date of sending the article to reviewers.

The editorial board informs the authors of the approved decision via e-mail. If the revision is required, the author has up to 1 month to complete it. After the author’s revision, the editorial board submits the article to the same reviewers for re-reviewing. Based on the results of the re-reviewing, the editorial staff decides on accepting of the revised article for its publication or rejecting it and informs the author thereof.

The Journal of Neuroscience Research will provide authors of good quality research that is outside the Journal's scope or that cannot be published in the Journal due to limited space with a referral and option to transfer their manuscript to Wiley’s Open Access Journal, Brain and Behavior. Authors will be offered the option of having the paper, along with any related peer reviews, automatically transferred for consideration by the Editor of Brain and Behavior. The transfer will occur on-line and guarantee the anonymity of the peer-review process. Authors will not need to reformat or rewrite their manuscript at this stage, and publication decisions will be made a short time after the transfer takes place. The Editor of Brain and Behavior will accept submissions that report well-conducted research, which reaches the standard acceptable for publication. Accepted papers can be published rapidly, typically within 20 days of acceptance. Brain and Behavior is a Wiley Open Access journal and article publication fees apply.  For more information please go to www.brain-behavior.com/info.

Wiley transferable peer review
JNR is participating in Wiley's transferable peer review scheme. Authors of original research articles that are rejected from the journal with completed reviews will be invited to transfer the manuscript, accompanied by the previous reviews, to any of the other Wiley journals participating in the scheme. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments prior to transfer if they wish to do so. A list of participating journals and more information about the scheme can be found here.

NPRC
The Journal of Neuroscience Research is a member of the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium. The Consortium is an alliance of neuroscience journals that have agreed to accept manuscript reviews from each other. If you submit a revision of your manuscript to another Consortium journal, we can forward the reviews of your manuscript to that journal, should you decide this might be helpful. You can find a list of Consortium journals and details about forwarding reviews at http://nprc.incf.org. Please note that the Wiley transferable peer review scheme is separate from the NPRC transfer system.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/10974547/homepage/forauthors.html,"Mandatory, Have date, Free to read (not paywalled)","Mandatory, Have date, Free to read (not paywalled)","Mandatory, Have date, Free to read (not paywalled)","No, Have date, Free to read (not paywalled)",Conditional,No,No,No,"Manuscripts submitted online are received on the day of submission are subject to stringent evaluation by the  Editor-in-Chief, and then distributed among the Associate Editors based on expertise. At this stage, submissions are assessed to ensure they fall within the scope of the journal and meet its high requirement for transparency, scientific rigor and novelty. If deemed suitable for peer review, the Associate Editor will send the manuscript to external reviewers with expertise in the topic and methods. This manuscript triage is essential to avoid undue burden on the peer-review system.

JNR operates using a transparent review process. We will be making peer review documentation (referees' de-anonymized reports, authors' responses and editors' comments) available alongside the published articles. Unblinding will occur only after a manuscript is accepted for publication, and reviews will remain anonymous until this point (reviewers' names will not be disclosed for manuscripts that are ultimately rejected). We believe that this will result in a more transparent and accountable process. Additional information about the transparent review process can be found in our editorial: The quest for transparent science: Open peer review.

We advise authors and institutions against seeking publicity and press coverage at the preprint stage. Conclusions may be toned down as the result of peer review and premature coverage may inaccurately reflect findings.

PLOS encourages authors to post preprints as a way to accelerate the dissemination of research.

PLOS partners with bioRxiv to make posting life sciences preprints easy and convenient.

Authors posting preprints to the bioRxiv preprint server may choose to concurrently submit their manuscripts to PLOS journals through the bioRxiv direct transfer service.

PLOS screens preprint submissions for bioRxiv suitability upon submission and before the manuscript enters the peer review process. The screening involves checks for:

Scope. Only submissions reporting primary research in biology and the life sciences are eligible for posting on bioRxiv. Read more about bioRxiv’s scope.
Inappropriate, inflammatory, or offensive language or content
Claims with implications for public health or other issues that should undergo peer review before posting
Text overlap
Dual use research of concern
Copyright. The authors must have the right to post the full submission, including figures, under a CC BY license. Read more about licenses and copyright.
Identifying personal information

Eligibility to post on bioRxiv is independent from the editorial assessment and peer review process. Preprint checks do not impact the decision regarding suitability for publication

PLOS encourages editors to consider comments and feedback available on the preprint record to inform their editorial decision, and where relevant, editors may incorporate those comments in their editorial feedback to authors.",http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/preprints,Any,"Yes, in the reference list",Yes,"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/press-and-media#loc-policy-for-preprints: ""PLOS does not embargo work that has been made available as a preprint. Authors may address questions about the preprint from the media before publication in PLOS ONE but are asked to stress that the work is undergoing peer review and may change as a result.

Authors should not disclose the journal where the work is under consideration until the work has been accepted for publication and assigned a publication date.

We advise authors and institutions against seeking publicity and press coverage at the preprint stage. Conclusions may be toned down as the result of peer review and premature coverage may inaccurately reflect findings. In addition, while prior publicity in the media will not affect decisions to publish work in a PLOS journal, it may affect decisions to publish in another journal. We recommend that authors and institutions distribute press releases for work posted as a preprint at or after the time of publication of the article.""","When submitted to bioRxiv via a PLOS journal: ""The authors must have the right to post the full submission, including figures, under a CC BY license.""","PLOS Biology has a 'scooping' policy, independent of preprints: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203","PLOS encourages editors to consider comments and feedback available on the preprint record to inform their editorial decision, and where relevant, editors may incorporate those comments in their editorial feedback to authors."

The Journal of Neuroscience Research will provide authors of good quality research that is outside the Journal's scope or that cannot be published in the Journal due to limited space with a referral and option to transfer their manuscript to Wiley’s Open Access Journal, Brain and Behavior. Authors will be offered the option of having the paper, along with any related peer reviews, automatically transferred for consideration by the Editor of Brain and Behavior. The transfer will occur on-line and guarantee the anonymity of the peer-review process. Authors will not need to reformat or rewrite their manuscript at this stage, and publication decisions will be made a short time after the transfer takes place. The Editor of Brain and Behavior will accept submissions that report well-conducted research, which reaches the standard acceptable for publication. Accepted papers can be published rapidly, typically within 20 days of acceptance. Brain and Behavior is a Wiley Open Access journal and article publication fees apply.  For more information please go to www.brain-behavior.com/info.

Wiley transferable peer review
JNR is participating in Wiley's transferable peer review scheme. Authors of original research articles that are rejected from the journal with completed reviews will be invited to transfer the manuscript, accompanied by the previous reviews, to any of the other Wiley journals participating in the scheme. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their manuscript according to the reviewers’ comments prior to transfer if they wish to do so. A list of participating journals and more information about the scheme can be found here.

NPRC
The Journal of Neuroscience Research is a member of the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium. The Consortium is an alliance of neuroscience journals that have agreed to accept manuscript reviews from each other. If you submit a revision of your manuscript to another Consortium journal, we can forward the reviews of your manuscript to that journal, should you decide this might be helpful. You can find a list of Consortium journals and details about forwarding reviews at http://nprc.incf.org.

Author self-archiving policy

Oxford University Press is proud of its generous self-archiving policy.
RCUK compliance

Our self-archiving policies are fully compliant with RCUK (Research Councils UK) requirements. Gold open access is offered, and where funding is not available, authors may follow the Green open access route. They may upload their accepted manuscript to institutional and centrally organized repositories, but must stipulate that public availability be delayed until 12 months after first online publication in the journal.
 
NIH compliance

For NIH grantees, we are fully compliant with the National Institute of Health (NIH) Public Access policy. Oxford University Press automatically deposits all NIH-funded papers into PMC, provided NIH is acknowledged by the author as a funding source.

For more information on Funder policies, click here.
Use of the link to the version of record

On publication of their article, authors will receive a URL, providing access without charge to the version of record on the Oxford Journal website. This link may then be sent to interested colleagues, or posted on the author’s own personal or institutional website.
Accepted manuscript

The accepted manuscript is defined here as the final draft author manuscript, as accepted for publication by a journal, including modifications based on referees’ suggestions, before it has undergone copyediting and proof correction.

Authors may upload their accepted manuscript PDF to an institutional and/or centrally organized repository, provided that public availability is delayed until 12 months after first online publication in the journal.

When uploading an accepted manuscript to a repository, authors should include the following acknowledgment as well as a link to the version of record. This will guarantee that the version of record is readily available to those accessing the article from public repositories, and means that the article is more likely to be cited correctly.

This is a pre-copyedited, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in [insert journal title] following peer review. The version of record [insert complete citation information here] is available online at: xxxxxxx [insert URL that the author will receive upon publication here].
 
Author’s original version

The author’s original version is defined here as the un-refereed author version of an article that is considered by the author to be of sufficient quality to be submitted for formal peer review by a second party. The author accepts full responsibility for the article, which may have a version number or date stamp and the content and layout is set out by the author. 

Authors can make their original version of the article available on their personal website, institutional websites, and on public pre-print servers.

On acceptance, the following statement should be added if possible:

This article has been accepted for publication in [Journal Title] Published by Oxford University Press.

 
Policy for Oxford Open articles only

Authors of Oxford Open articles are entitled to deposit their accepted manuscript or the version of record in institutional and/or centrally organized repositories and can make this publicly available immediately upon publication, provided that the journal and OUP are attributed as the original place of publication and that correct citation details are given. Authors should also deposit the URL of their published article, in addition to the PDF version.

The journal strongly encourages Oxford Open authors to deposit the version of record instead of the accepted manuscript. This will guarantee that the definitive version is readily available to those accessing your article from such repositories, and means that your article is more likely to be cited correctly.

Oxford Journals automatically deposits open access articles in PMC for the majority of journals participating in Oxford Open. For a list of journals involved and for the latest information on the status of PMC deposits for individual journals please see journals which offer an open access model.
